# Harmonize

## Mission Statement
Harmonize was created to help people with debt, specifically college students with loans, save money and pay off their debt by helping them prioritize their spending. The Chrome Extension allows users to visualize their frivolous spending and the potential impact it could have when saved for repaying loans/debt.
